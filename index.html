        <h3>Welcome to Mozilla-session-slides</h3>

<p>This is the slides that I used on 16th April, 2012 for the talk on Mozilla. The event was my first talk on Mozilla as a ReMo. It was organized in association with LUG Maniapl. It covers various topics on Mozilla, ranging from other projects by Mozilla and How to contribute to Mozilla. Contribution to Mozilla is a great topic as it can be extended to both developers and non-developers. We also covered MDN Docs as I am also the MDN Docs reps. MDN, Mozilla Developer Network is a great resource for Web Development.</p>

<p>The beauty of the slides is that, it prepared in deck.js and is in support to open Web.</p>

<p>I here by allow everyone to use these slides freely for professional and educational purpose. Though I request you to please drop in your mails at vikashagrawal1990@gmail.com and tweets to ivikashagrawal. I would love to hear from you.</p>
