The event was my first talk on Mozilla as a ReMo. It was organized in association with LUG Maniapl. It covers various topics on Mozilla, ranging from other projects by Mozilla and How to contribute to Mozilla. Contribution to Mozilla is a great topic as it can be extended to both developers and non-developers. We also covered MDN Docs as I am also the MDN Docs reps. MDN, Mozilla Developer Network is a great resource for Web Development.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the slides is that, it prepared in deck.js and is in support to open Web.\r\n\r\nI here by allow everyone to use these slides freely for professional and educational purpose.
